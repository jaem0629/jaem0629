I'm Jaemin Lee, a software engineer who values writing fresh and clean code.

I like the saying "Perfection is achieved when there's nothing left to remove." That's why I aim for minimal duplication and sensible structure.

Beyond just solving problems, I think about ways to boost productivity. I enjoy improving developer and user experience through type automation, caching, and performance optimization.

I work with React and TypeScript, and I'm drawn to declarative data fetching like GraphQL.

In my free time, I learn new technologies, play games, and find inspiration listening to jazz.

Currently working as a Frontend Developer at PublicAI in Seoul.

## Impact at PublicAI

Joined as first frontend engineer with only Flutter experience. Learned React and TypeScript while shipping production features. In 1.5 years, established frontend standards across 10+ projects.

**AI Coding Agents** — Adopted Cursor and Copilot when the company only used ChatGPT. Proved impact through development speed improvements. Now company-wide standard, doubling team productivity.

**OAS-based Type Generation** — Adopted Orval for REST APIs. Automated 100+ endpoint types, eliminating manual maintenance and field-name bugs.

**GraphQL with DB-first Approach** — Proposed PostGraphile for admin-heavy products. Backend engineers no longer write filters, pagination, or GET endpoints. Admin development 60% faster. Adopted in RAG Stack, RAMP, and NTS projects.

**BFF Architecture Exploration** — Built BFF layer to enable Relay cache benefits with Python REST backends. Later simplified to REST + route cache invalidation due to maintenance overhead.

**Scaling Knowledge** — Contributing to open source (Shadcn, Orval) to learn large-scale patterns and team collaboration as sole frontend engineer. Applying insights to internal architecture.
