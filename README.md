Software engineer pursuing **Fresh & Clean** code — simple, readable, and well-structured.

I believe "perfection is achieved when there's nothing left to remove." I aim for minimal duplication and sensible architecture.

Beyond just solving problems, I focus on boosting team-wide productivity. I find fulfillment in improving both developer and user experience through type automation, caching, and performance optimization.

My primary stack is React and TypeScript, with a interest in declarative data fetching via GraphQL.

In my free time, I explore new technologies, play games, or find inspiration listening to jazz.

Currently working as a Frontend Developer at PublicAI in Seoul,
