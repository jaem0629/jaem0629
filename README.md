I'm Jaemin Lee, a software engineer who values fresh and clean code.

I believe perfection comes not from adding more, but from taking away. This shapes how I approach code — minimal duplication, clear structure, nothing unnecessary.

Beyond solving problems, I want to make my teammates' work easier. Type automation, caching, and performance optimization are tools I use to improve both developer and user experience.

My primary stack is React and TypeScript. I'm drawn to declarative data fetching, especially GraphQL.

In my free time, I explore new technologies, play games, or find inspiration listening to jazz.

Currently working as a Frontend Developer at PublicAI in Seoul.
