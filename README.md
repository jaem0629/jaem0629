I'm Jaemin Lee, a software engineer who values writing fresh and clean code.

I like the saying "Perfection is achieved when there's nothing left to remove." That's why I aim for minimal duplication and sensible structure.

Beyond just solving problems, I think about ways to boost productivity. I enjoy improving developer and user experience through type automation, caching, and performance optimization.

I work with React and TypeScript, and I'm drawn to declarative data fetching like GraphQL.

In my free time, I learn new technologies, play games, and find inspiration listening to jazz.

Currently working as a Frontend Developer at PublicAI in Seoul.
